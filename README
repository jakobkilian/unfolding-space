The “Unfolding Space” glove is an open source navigation aid system for the visually impaired.
The project deals with sensory substitution: A phenomenon by
which the function of one missing or dysfunctional sensory modality is replaced
(substituted) by stimulating another one. The outcome is a prototype that
projects a 3D picture, generated by a special camera, as vibration patterns on
the back of the hand.
The blind can therefore use their tactile modality of the hand to actually see.
