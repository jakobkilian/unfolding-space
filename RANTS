Holy Shit "There's only one fucking way to do things" Python assholes.


Ubuntu 20.04 does not support Python 3.6 which libroyale requires.

Follow the following pattern from LazyOverflow, and adding the totally
legit sounding ppa 'deadsnakes' which surely must also be shrivelled
penis fetish porn:

Install python 3.6:

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install python3.6
	
	#If the virtualenv package is not installed, run:

	apt-get update
	apt-get install python3-virtualenv
	
	#Create a virtual environment:

	virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.6 venv

Them you need to install a random bag-of-shit including:

    - libpython3.5 (Did I mention you need 3.5 not 3.6 like the
      libroyale docs state?) (with apt)
    - numpy and opencv (with pip)
