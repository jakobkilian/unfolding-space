This directory contains udev-rules files.
See https://wiki.debian.org/udev for explanation how
udev rules work.

If you are using ubuntu, copy the .rules file to
/etc/udev/rules.d/ to use pmd devices without administrative
privileges (you will need root rights once to copy the file
to the destination):

sudo cp 10-royale-ubuntu.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

Please make sure that the user is in the group plugdev!

After copying the udev rule, please unplug and reinsert the camera.
